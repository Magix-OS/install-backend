#+title:  Magix installer back-end


This repository hosts the source code for the installation back-end for Magix Linux, a Gentoo based distribution, spiritual successor of [[https://github.com/wamuu-sudo/orchid][Orchid Linux]]

Currently only *amd64* is supported, sorry gang!

* Dependencies :

Currently only *libjansson* and *meson* are required to build and use this installer.


* How to build :


#+BEGIN_SRC shell
meson setup builddir
cd builddir
ninja # Or meson compile
#+END_SRC


* How to use :

All you need is a json file in [[https://github.com/Magix-OS/coding-conventions][This format]] and pass it as an argument to the resulting binary.

** Notes :

- All checks should be done in the frontend, refer to the Coding conventions repository for more info.
- This installer WILL fail in the case of No Internet and Missing permissions, so this should be taken care of in the installer.
